- Prefix code with `@app` where required.
- Always use **function components**; **never** use default exports.
- **Server components** for dumb UI; **client components** for browser logic, Suspense/lazy loading as needed.
- File names in **kebab-case**; React component files in **PascalCase**.
- Use **React Hooks**, Zustand / TanStack Query for state & data, **Formik + Zod** for forms/validation.
- Style with **Tailwind CSS** + daisyUI; no Tailwind string concatenation—write full class names.
- Icons from **react-feather** (`import { IconName } from 'react-feather'`).
- Follow **Next.js app-router** patterns; keep business logic separate from UI.
- TypeScript everywhere; adhere to **AirBnB** style and **biome** lint/format rules.
- Check `ARCHITECTURE.md`; think sequentially and cache helpful search results.
- Use `medusaj` hook (see `medusa/` and `hooks/` folders).
- Optimize with lazy loading, caching, and clear modular structure.
- Dev-Ops: slim Docker images, harden isolation, tune networking/volumes, plan HA orchestration.
- Skip READMEs or setup instructions unless explicitly requested—go straight to code.
