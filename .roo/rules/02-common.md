- Prefix code with `@app` where required.
- Always use **function components**; only use default export for Pages.
- **Server components** for dumb UI; **client components** for browser logic, Suspense/lazy loading as needed.
- React component files in **PascalCase**; File names in **kebab-case**.
- Use TanStack Query for state & data, **Formik + Zod** for forms/validation.
- Style with **Tailwind CSS** + daisyUI; no Tailwind string concatenation — write full class names and use twMerge if required.
- Icons from **react-feather** (`import { IconName } from 'react-feather'`).
- Follow **Next.js app-router** patterns; keep business logic separate from UI.
- TypeScript everywhere; adhere to **AirBnB** style and **prettier & eslint** lint/format rules.
- Check `ARCHITECTURE.md`; think sequentially and cache helpful search results.
- Optimize with lazy loading, caching, and clear modular structure.
- Dev-Ops: slim Docker images, harden isolation, tune networking/volumes, plan HA orchestration.
- Skip READMEs or setup instructions unless explicitly requested—go straight to code.
